/// The `RainConfig` struct allows you to tailor the `RainView` to your needs with a lot of configuration options.
///
/// You can use the default parameters to get a fine-tuned effect with reasonable settings. However you can also go full customization-mode and set each parameter how you like it and experiment with it.
///
/// - Parameters:
///     - content: This is an array of `Content` enum objects. You can see its documentation for how to use/implement those  (see ``Content`` for more information). It offers the following cases: `.image`, `.emoji`,  and `.shape`. Default value here is an image of a rain drop you can see in the `Resources` folder..
///     - `backgroundColor`: The background color (of type `Color`) of the view that contains the effect. Default is `.clear`.
///     - `intensity`: The intensity of the effect.  It will be translated into different values internally that will lead to varying intensities of the effect. The type is ``Intensity`` and it can take the different values `.low`, `medium` and `high`. For more information on what it does see the documentation for the ``Intensity`` type. Default in this case is `.medium`.
///     - `lifetime`: Defines how long the single elements of the effect will stay alive. The type is ``Lifetime`` (click to see more details) and it has the values `.short`, `.medium` and `.long`. Default is `.medium`.
///     - `initialVelocity`: Specifies the initial speed with which rain particles will be emitted from the source. The higher the value the larger the radius of the effects as elements will spread in a larger radius around the source. The type is ``InitialVelocity`` and possible values are `.slow`, `.medium`, and `.fast`. Default value is `.medium`.
///     - `fadeOut`: Specifies how fast elements of the effect will fade out (meaning: become transparent). Difference to `lifetime` is that there elements will be removed instantly whereas here there is a fading effect that is more subtle over time. The type is ``FadeOut`` (click to see more details) with the values `.none`, `.slow`, `.medium`, and `.fast`. Default is `.medium`.
///     - `spreadRadius`: Defines the angle in which the single elements of the effect are emitted. The type ``SpreadRadius`` (click to see more details) defines 3 values: `.low`, `.medium`, and `.high`. The default is `.high` (leading to a complete circle of particles emitted from the source).
///     - emitterPosition: Describes the position of the root of the effect. Implemented as an enum with the following options: `.top`, `.center`, and `.bottom`. Default value is `.top`.
///     - clipsToBounds: specifies whether the effect is constrained to the `RainView` itself or can leak around. Default is `false` (effect leaks outside).
///     - fallDirection: an enum value of type `FallDirection`. There are two options for now, being `.upwards` (particles are moving up the screen from the source they are emitted) and `.downwards` (particles are falling downwards from the origin of the source). Default is `.downwards`.
