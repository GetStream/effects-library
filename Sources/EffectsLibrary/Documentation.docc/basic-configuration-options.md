# Basic effect configuration options

This article gives an overview over the configuration options that are common for all affects in the package.


## Overview

We aim to build our effects in a way that it's easy and intuitive to use. However, this might not always be possible, so in this article we want to exaplain to you the basic effect configuration options (meaning: parameters of `Config` files) that you can use for each and every effect of our package.

If there's still things remaining unclear, feel free to contact us for clarification.

The configuration options that are shared for all effects are the following:

- `content`: `[Content]`
- `backgroundColor`: `Color`
- `intensity`: ``Intensity``
- `lifetime`: ``Lifetime``
- `initialVelocity`: ``InitialVelocity``
- `fadeOut`: ``FadeOut``
- `spreadRadius`: ``SpreadRadius``

## Explanations of options

Let's go over all the options we have and discuss what they do and mean.

### content

The `content` parameter is one of the most powerful options we have. It allows you to set the content of the single particles all of our effects are made of. It is actually an array of ``Content`` objects. The ``Content`` type is a custom `enum` which can take multiple values, specifically the following three:

- `.shape`
- `.image`
- `.emoji`

In our advanced tutorial we go over how to use each of those, so let's only quickly see some examples of how to define the content array (we've actually taken this example directly from the tutorial itself). 

```Swift
let content: [Content] = [
    .shape(.triangle, .blue, 10.0),
    .shape(.square, .green, 10.0),
    .shape(.circle, .red, 10.0),
    .emoji("ðŸš€", 10.0),
    .emoji("ðŸ’¥", 3.0),
    .image(UIImage(named: "stream-logo")!, nil, 0.8)
]
```

It demonstrates how to exactly configure each of the parameter types. For the `.image` it requires us to have an image with the name `stream-logo` in the Assets folder.

Each content item always has a scaling parameter as the last option as well. This is used so that you can manually scale the size of each particle. This gives you the power to e.g. combine differently sized images with emojis and shapes and fine-tune them so that they are of equal size.

The `.shape` and `.image` parameters have an optional `UIColor` option as well. This allows you to directly tint the pieces in any way you like. You can also leave this as `nil` to have the effect take care of coloring the particles itself.

For each of the effects we have a sensible default `content` parameter which is different in every case. However, as this library is open-source you can always have a look at the source code. The `Config` files have default parameters and you can find the `content` definitions there.
 
### backgroundColor

As the name suggests this allows you to set a background color on your effects. By default this is set to `.clear` so that you can place the effects on top of other UI elements (`ZStack` is our friend here.). But you're free to set this to any value you like.

### intensity

### lifetime

### initialVelocity

### fadeOut

### spreadRadius
